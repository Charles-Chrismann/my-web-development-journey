This is an exaustive list of the tools/apps I use/need as a Javascript/Node fullstack developer.

### Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is by far the most used version control system in any development project.

### Github

[Github](https://github.com/) automatically goes with Git since it the reference concerning git repositories managements.

### Node

As a fullstack javascript developern [Node](https://nodejs.org) is the runtime of javascript out of the browser. It comes with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), the Node Package Manager wich allow you to manage your dependancies and globally install tools.

### Visual Studio Code

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a simple but complete text editor. It is not an IDE.\
VS Code allow you to easily download and install a bunch of free plugins, I personnally use the followings:

- Live Server: A developpement server that enable hot reloading for vanilla web projects.
- Markdown Preview Github Styling: to mimic Github's markdown
- Remote Explorer: An SSH client that allows you to visualise the files present on you server.
- GitHub Copilot: The Github's AI to predic your code. (Free with student license)

### Postman

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a tool used to make requests and to test your API endpoints.

### Firefox & Chrome

[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/new/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com) are my main browsers. I use Firefox as my development browser beacause i prefer the DevTools, I use Chrome to check the compatibility of my code since Chrome is the most used browser. Also, Chrome have earlier functionnality release and seems to work better to render while animating canvas.

### Browser Extensions
[Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/) allow you to know what technologies (frameworks, libraries, analytics...) are present on the website your are consulting
