# My Web Development Journey

This repository keeps track of my discoveries on my Javascript learning journey. It deliberately uses descriptive naming instead of technical jargon to help beginners with limited technical knowledge to easily understand the functionalities and actions they are trying to perform.

I'm primarily a JavaScript/Node.js web developer and not the best, so in this repository, you will probably find a lot of content about web development, DevOps, and how the internet works. Again, this may not be 100% accurate since it is just my understanding of these topics.

My motivation to create this repository is to have a single place to store the solutions to problems I've encountered and easily find them. If these solutions could help others, I'm happy to share them.

Another motivation for creating this repository is to keep track of my areas of limited understanding, which will encourage me to explore certain subjects more deeply while providing explanations on more basic topics.

Please note that this repository is NOT intended to be a proof of good practices and does NOT claim to be the best way to do things.
