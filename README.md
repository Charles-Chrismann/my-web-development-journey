# My Web Development Journey

This repository keeps track of my discoveries on my Javascript learning journey. It deliberately uses descriptive naming instead of technical jargon to help beginners with limited technical knowledge to easily understand the functionalities and actions they are trying to perform.

I'm primarily a JavaScript/Node.js web developer and not the best, so in this repository, you will probably find a lot of content about web development, DevOps, and how the internet works. Again, this may not be 100% accurate since it is just my understanding of these topics.

My motivation to create this repository is to have a single place to store the solutions to problems I've encountered and easily find them. If these solutions could help others, I'm happy to share them.

Another motivation for creating this repository is to keep track of my areas of limited understanding, which will encourage me to explore certain subjects more deeply while providing explanations on more basic topics.

Please note that this repository is NOT intended to be a proof of good practices and does NOT claim to be the best way to do things.

## Learn Web Development

In this section, will not describe how I started to learn web development but rather how many developpers advise to learn it.

First of all, tutorials a good way to learn the basic of html/css/javascript, but be aware to not fall in what is called the [tutorial hell](https://trujillo9616.medium.com/what-is-tutorial-hell-d24c1bdb279f). The tutorial hell is when you follow many tutorials wich gives you the feeling to understand a lot but when it comes to make you own project you have no idea where to start.

This is why it is a better to learn the language in order to be able to understand every line of a tutorial.

[roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) provides multiple step by step roadmaps to learn differents technologies.

You can find more ressources in the [learning section](./raw/ressources-for/learning.md) of the [ressources for](./raw/ressources-for/index.md) topic

### Ask for help

Learning comes with a lot of interrogations and issues. Asking for help is absolutely normal and most of the developpers will be happy to help you if they have time for and if the problem/question is well formulated here are some ressources on how to and how to not ask for help:

- [Don't ask to ask just ask](https://dontasktoask.com/)
- [Learn JavaScript Before Asking](https://stifskere.github.io/LearnJsBeforeAsking/)
- [Ask about your attempted solution rather than your actual problem](https://xyproblem.info/)
- [No hello](https://nohello.net/fr/)
- [How do I ask a good question?](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)
- [How to create a Minimal, Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)
- [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)
